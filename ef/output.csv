"04.05.2010, 00:23",evilshell,The rules - read these before you post or your thread could be deleted,"Before you post anything in this section, be sure you have read this sticky and followed the rules. If you don't, your thread could be deleted by the mods. Just because you're a forum veteran doesn't mean you don't need to read this sticky and follow the rules. 
In order to start a new thread in the Marketplace, you need to first meet the following criteria: Have 10 posts or more Been a member for 7 days or longer Title
Make your title descriptive, short and to the point. It should conform to the following format: 
[Free] Leather sofa [Basel]
[Free] Woman's bicycle [Geneva]
[Free] Household items, moving sale [Zurich]
Thread titles must include free, the name of the item and the location. Description
What are you giving away? Tell us as much about it as you can. 
For example:   Quote:    Free washing machine in Zurich
Brand: Miele
Height: 80cm
Width: 65cm
Depth: 40cm
Color: White
Small scratches on the side of the machine
1 year old
Capacity: 4.5 kg
Pick up in Dietikon
PM me for details      Picture
A picture is worth a thousand words, or so the cliche goes. But with most household goods, it will help you get rid of your item. 
Try and take a photo that shows the item as clearly as possible, not a small dot across the room. Upload the photo to the English Forum and then embed it into your post, or post it to an external website and use the photo insert tool to include it in your post. Thread BumpingThreads should not be bumped just to gain new exposure. This is considered a breach of netiquette and should be avoided. For more info, please consult Bump_(Internet)
If you want to bring your thread to the top of the pile, post a response to the thread with some new or updated info. It is also acceptable to state that the item is still available if the thread has been there for a few days with no activity. Repeat Postings of the Same Item
Absolutely forbidden. If the mod seeing it is in a nice mood, they might just merge your existing posts, but chances are you'll find your duplicates deleted. General Netiquette
This should be observed at all times. NetiquettePhone Numbers and Email Addresses
Forum rules prohibit the posting of personal contact information including email addresses and telephone numbers. Please use the PM feature instead. Threads with of personal contact information including phone numbers or email addresses will be edited by the mods. What to do when your item is gone
Please report the original post in your thread and ask that it be closed due to the item being taken. Use the Report Post feature, which is the triangle with ! in the middle on the top right hand corner of your post. Language
It should go without saying, we're the English forum, so your post should be in English. (That goes for all sections of EF, not just the Market Place!)Txtspk
Use txtspk and risk having your post or thread deleted without mercy. Remember, English isn't everyone's first language - and even for those who do have English as a first language, txtspk is difficult to read quickly. It doesn't make you look clever or even save you time, so please, use proper English.Trolling
Trolling and taunting the seller is not permitted. Your posts will be deleted, and you could face a ban. By all means, ask legitimate questions, but trolling will not be permitted. 
Not sure what trolling is? wiki/Troll_(Internet)Important Info
Not following these rules will probably find a mod deleting your post. You don't want that, so follow the rules and happy selling and buying. 
Following the rules is simple and easy. Repeatedly violating them is not. Repeated disregard or violation of the rules is cause for an instant ban from the forum. A couple of tips for safe trading
Don't give your full street address until date/time/transport have been arranged to your mutual satisfaction. Street name and nearest tram/bus stop is good enough for initial planning. Sellers often offer to meet at the station - they needn't give away their home address.
Don't outline your whole schedule. If a prospective buyer wants to know when he can come by, state your general preference (e.g. daytime or evening) and make one or two initial suggestions. If he can't meet either of those, ask him for a list of four times that would work for him. You pick one of them and that's it.
If a particular date/time doesn't work for you, it is ""inconvenient"" and nothing more. Don't give reasons.Disclaimer
englishforum.ch is not responsible for goods sold on the forum. We do not benefit from the sales in any way. Any englishforum.ch endorsed sales will be otherwise specified.

It isn't worth transporting it back to the UK with me as I already have a furnished house there.Location: 1803 Chardonne, near (but up a big hill from) La Baume funicular.  Will give exact address if you PM.
Therefore all these items are available for free as long as you can collect them on the evening of 21st, 22nd or 23rd January (may be able to arrange for during the day or early the following week, but unfortunately not the weekend!)Ideally collect on Monday 21st, Tuesday 22nd or Wednesday 23rd from 1830-2230, PM for address, strictly first collect first served as I need to clear it all quickly but I can supply my mobile number via PM if anyone wishes to check before leaving that things are still there.  However because I need to clear it all quickly (and because it would get really complicated) I'm afraid I cannot reserve items for people.
I do not have my own vehicle so cannot deliver.
It's all IKEA furniture, mostly in white, nothing ""fancy"" but perfectly usable and in decent condition, about 1.5 years old.

Please contact me by private message on the forum if you are interested and I can arrange 
a time for you to collect.
Because of limited time this is strictly first to collect first served (on the dates shown), I will update the posting when things are collected, I can't risk ending up with anything left because I will have to pay for it to be removed, and dumping it all would seem such a waste!

"18.09.2012, 20:44",NewOneINseefeld,Please donate your old toys for poor and abandoned kids.,"Dear EF members and guests,
I would like to organize a charity project for children who are very poor, orphaned, abandoned, mentally handicapped and/or disabled, in Serbia.
I would like to collect your old (or new but never used) and not too big: toys, plush toys/animals, games, decorative items (for Xmas and Bdays), books, baby toys, kids and baby items, items for (pre)school, etc. - to give To as many of those kids as possible a 'second hand' Christmas/New Years presents. Their Christmas is on January 6/7th, and New Year is traditional - on December 31st.
I will organize the transportation of these presents to Serbia.
I contacted four organisations/institutions who have lots of children from the above groups. (Located in the eastern part of Serbia - Milosevac: 180 babies&kids, Stamnica: 50, Veliki Popovac: (?), Pomoc Romima-Branicevo: 1200).
As a follow-up I will send to all of you the information about the dates of transport, packing, meeting with children in every institution, and photos whenever I received them.
Please let me know if you have anything to give away but in return get back lots of smiles and thankful kids' hearts!
Thank you for reading this and helping me with this project.
Grateful,
Maya"

It is no longer in the package but has never been used.  It comes with two small cups, is dual voltage, and holds about 2 cups (less than .5 L) of liquid.

"16.10.2012, 10:39",elainemay,[Free] Box spring and bed frame [Zurich],"I have a US queen/UK king size box spring and accompanying basic metal bed frame that I'd like to give away. Please note that this is a US-style box spring, which means it goes underneath a mattress to provide support and stability (i.e. you don't need a lattenrost/wooden slats thingy). It is not a mattress.
The box spring is a Sealy Posturepedic that fits a US queen mattress or a UK king mattress.  It is about 153 cm x 200 cm, which means it might also work with a European 160 cm x 200 cm mattress with a couple of centimeters of overhang on each side. Info on mattress sizes
The bed frame is a standard metal one that adjusts in width and is designed to hold a box spring. It dissembles into two pieces that fold up. It's not a lattenrost- you can't put a mattress in it without a box spring underneath.
Both are in great condition- we used them for about a year before getting a new bed frame that doesn't require a box spring. There are some small scuffs on the box spring from being moved, but it's otherwise clean and in good condition, no stains, odors, or tears.
Please please please, I hope someone can use these items- I hate to take large items in good condition to the dump, and the Brockenhaus doesn't want them because they don't know what a box spring is  I can't deliver, but I will happily help you move them to your vehicle!
Here are some pictures. Yep, it looks like a big rectangle. Pardon the dark areas- those are just shadows and bad phone pic artifacts.  The actual thing is clean and uniform in color. The bed frame is currently in the attic and folded up, but I'm including a picture of a similar one."

Preferably i would like to sell them as a pair so will offer a deal for the two.
I am selling them for 50CHF each or 90CHF for the two if sold to a single purchaser - perfect for someone setting up a new apartment and need furniture.
I have attached pictures of the sofas

"19.09.2012, 12:28",10:30,FREE - Basel - Beautiful Large Carpet,"Hi everyone, as part of my new life, I'm parting with my Enormous Carpet. Its origin is unknown, but it's certainly not some Ikea trash. Its basic color is reddish, but is intricately detailed with various patterns. I'm not going to swear that it's handmade, but it's certainly a special piece.
And it's very large: probably 4m x 4m. It's too big for my new space. I can't even unfold it properly. Damn shame.
And so, since I'm off to the US tomorrow (Thursday 20 Sept, very early) for a long trip, I'm committing a giant sin and putting the carpet out on the street with a gratis sign. If anyone feels inclined, swing by with a cart or a car (it is rather heavy) and it's yours. It's right now out in front of:
Bechburgerstrasse 10 (Breite area of Basel, Tramstop Breite)
The pics don't do it justice. I could only unfold one tiny corner, and there's a pic of the folded carpet. https://picasaweb.google.com/1048733...eat=directlink"

Free for immediate pick up. 
This is a fine wardrobe/armoire/closet thing, probably from Ikea (though I don't know its Ikea name). 
A bit funky -- funny pegs jut out the front in a square matrix, and an elastic band snakes around the pegs. 
What for? I don't know!
Anyways, it'll certainly contain clothing for you, if that's what you're looking for. And the price is right.
The only catch is this is very short notice, as we've got to be out of here by 31 July, Tuesday. It's all still put together, but I could help take it apart if you want. I'll even help take it down to a vehicle. It just has to be cleared out by Tuesday. 
Take a look at the pictures. If you want it, please come and get it. 
Sorry I don't have exact measurements right now. It's about 2m high, and deeper than it is wide. I'd guess about 50-60 cm deep (the width of a normal shirt or coat hanger), and probably 45-55 cm wide (looking at its door from the front).

I have attached a picture of one - not my bed, but this is what it looks like. I have a picture at home, which I can get later on, but I am at work right now. The frame is in decent shape. I think perhaps some of the holes for where the screws drill into, may need a little work, to secure the bed more, but I have used the bed for 2 years now, and it has been ok.
 the bed is 160X200. I am not sure how old it is, as I got it from someone else that was leaving Switzerland. 
 One Caution: The mattress - I would prefer if you took the mattress too, but it does have a few cat urine stains on it (figured i would warn you) -- which they could probably be cleaned up better than I did. Got to love the cats... unfortunately they took it out on my bed when I first got my cats -- ..... I will consider just the frame by itself, since I know that is probably gross - but it can be cleaned more and covered with the right sheet so it would not affect you -- but preference goes to anyone that will take both together... (and i am not even sure how to dispose of the mattress)

(yes its in the pic - bottom left of the table ) I think it is a 13 inch tv or thereabouts... it works ... it has a built in vhs player -- not sure if that works, but I imagine one does not want it for that.. nice for a kitchen or someplace you dont want a big tv at  Has a remote control also.. I can not think of the brand or anything, since I got it used - but it is free  so send me a message if you want to get it.
Can be picked up tomorrow (Saturday - June 30th) otherwise I am gone  for a week to Munich, and pick up could take place late Saturday on July  7th or anytime on Sunday the 8th.
 Please PM me if you want these, and we can arrange pick up.

They are 2 wardrobes of 150cm Width x 58cm Depth x 200cm Height.

I am wondering if anyone has a bunch of boy clothes for the age of 9 months - 1 1/2 or 2yrs lying around in bags or boxes that they are no longer using and would like to clear out of their house? 
Myself, my sister and my sister in law all have baby boys around this age and would need clothes for both seasons (summer and winter) in this age category. 
I know how hard it can be to clear out clothes (I needed to do it for my 2 girls recently) and ended up just giving away all of their clothes to a friend who needed them for her baby, and it worked out a lot easier than the hassle of having to try and sell individual pieces, send them to the second hand shops etc... so if anyone else would be willing to do the same - ie. giving away their baby clothes as one lot, I would love to come and pick them up from you anywhere in the Zurich region. 
Please PM me if you have any you would like to clear out.

"05.03.2012, 11:58",mirfield,Brown Sugar [Basel],"We have a bag of Silver Spoon Light Brown Soft Sugar that we dont need.
It's not like anyone in Switzerland would want such a thing (I did a search on EF), so we're trying to palm it off to some naif to save us the effort and expense of disposing of it at the local treaclesammelnpunkt.Cat not included.
The bag says that the sugar is soft.  But to be honest, while the sugar has a certain squishyness, its definitely not as soft as the aforementioned cat.
The bag also states that the sugar is light.  But its not the sort of thing youd want to be smacked in the face with.  Id estimate that it weighs about a kilo (2.2 English lbs (Who knows what in American  probably a couple of cups (those big ones that you get in Starbucks probably))).
Also, the bag states that the sugar is brown.  While Ive not opened the bag to check, I find that often it is more of a tan colour.  And definitely paler than the brown bits of a King Charles Spaniel (Id say closer to maybe a golden retriever).Silver spoon not included.
So, anyway.  If anybody wants a bag of sugar with lies printed on the bag then PM.
In the unlikely case that more than one person wants it, then a biased and nepotistic selection process will take place. Warning  Keep away from cats."

The header tape enables you to gather it so meaning they can fit behind variable widths of curtains depending on how tight you gather them.

Anyway, in true family style, I forgot about the cake over Christmas (how often did I laugh at my mother for doing that) and we still have two cakes left .
We have started on one and whilst it is very yummy, neither of the children eat fruit cake, and I am supposed to be dieting, so would anyone like the second cake? I have been assiduously feeding it with brandy so it should be really rather nice. It has not been covered in marzipan or icing (but I also have the packet of ready made marzipan and can give you the royal icing recipe).
Incidentally they are generally best eaten in the first 6 months after making, but will easily last over a year. This one should just be in its prime!

We've recently upgraded and I therefore have a Canon S750 photo printer to give away if anyone wants it, before it goes to electronic recycling heaven.
It's had very low use over the years, and is fully functioning all except for what appears to be a few blocked nozzles in the printhead resulting in stripy output.

Complete with original box, manual, installation CDs.
It's an old model, so no longer available, but google still yields some old info and reviews, such as this:http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Prod...S750/index.asphttp://www.ephotozine.com/article/ca...er-review-4601

"31.12.2011, 01:29",MaryH,Basel-> Giving away...20 German magazines NEON,"Hi German learners and lovers!
""Read, read and... read"" - Learning a foreign language, you probably have heard this often!  Of course there are books, and I still think they are a great way to learn new vocabulary, but I actually find magazines very interesting too to learn new idioms while reading about various topics. 
I personally love the German magazine NEON! This magazine doesn't tell you how to lose 40 pounds in one week nore how to get the best suntan without sunbathing.  Instead of that, this half serious/half fun magazine contains loads of articles about politics, society, economy, psychology, feelings, culture and of course some fun stuff too, and doesnt mind breaking taboos (I swear they didnt pay me to write this, hehe!).
Now that Ive read every page of them (ok, I dont know them by heart yet) and that they start piling up in my bedroom (have 20 of them now), I think the time has come to get rid of them.  At first I simply wanted to throw them away while sorting out the ""Papier"" and ""Karton"" for recycling, but in the end I thought it might interest some of you to read these magazines for free! 
If you want to have a closer look to what this magazine is all about, you can check out the website: http://www.neon.de/
If you are interested, please PM me!
I wish you all a happy New Year!
Best wishes,
Mary"

So tomorrow my hubby is planning to take to decheterie 20 or something volumes of the famous French encyclopedia. That's what Wikipedia says about that ( sorry for French, I can't translate)
L'Encyclopédie Alpha est une encyclopédie française des années 1970 en quinze volumes, richement illustrés, que chaque acquéreur constituait par la réunion de fascicules vendus chaque semaine dans les boutiques de journaux, à l'aide d'une reliure proposée à la vente quand les dix-huit fascicules d'un tome étaient disponibles.
L'encyclopédie généraliste a été suivie de plusieurs autres consacrées au cinéma, aux peuples du monde, à la mer, etc.
I know what I would do with it in my Motherland. Would take to the orphans house or another place like that. And here i have no idea. So if somebody would like we are on the lake Geneva near Allaman. To Zurich we also can deliver because any way travel often.

I've recently replaced my bed slats as the old ones were, apparently, not set up to take the kind of activity they got.

If you care to haul it away, it's yours.

The sleeping area will comfortably sleep two six-footers plus a child - it was bought specifically for its size as I am tall.
The cooking/storage area can also be zipped down to make a completely enclosed space about 5 metres long. Cooking area does not have a groundsheet.
The whole thing is bulky and heavy, and is the kind of tent that you pitch at a camp site for a week, not one that you could carry in a backpack. It was bought in 1986 but has not been used much, and has been stored in my cellar/garage for the last 15 years.
Unfortunately I cannot post a photo as I have nowhere to erect the tent to take pictures of it, but the sketch below will give you an idea of the kind of thing it is.

"07.10.2011, 11:25",Venturello,"[For Free] Bed + Mattress, 1.50x2.00, with large storage space [Hünenberg, Zug]","Hello all,
I am giving away a used bed, with mattress,bought in Spain 6 years ago. It measures 1.50x2.00. Mattress has normal stains (coffee, wine) but all in all in acceptable condition. We also include some sheets if you want them.
Check here a couple of pictures: http://imgur.com/a/FP9ya
It is currently disassembled (easy to put back together, all parts included of course) must pick in Hünenberg, Zug.
The bed has a very large storage space underneath. The spring system works very well, it is comfortable in that when it's up (with the full weight of the mattress on top), it keeps itself open, so you can move stuff in and out without worrying about keeping the lid open. The mechanism works perfectly. Things inside are well protected, it 'seals' well, no dust gets in.
You must pick up and have transportation. Bed frame can be disassembled but large board for mattress (the piece that moves up and support the mattress) is one solid piece. Also the mattress being a spring mattress and tall, does not bend a lot. Thus, the large piece (1.50x1.80) and mattress does not fit in a normal van (we tried our Honda Odyssey and a Seat Alhambra) - you need something larger.

We bought a house in Thalwil and would like to give away the Swedish oven that came with it.  It is dark red/burgundy in colour but will probably need repainting.  These ovens sold for thousands when new, we just want it gone so we can have the space back so we are not interested in any money for it.  Unfortunately where the oven was in the lounge room is where we wanted to put our tv, so it had to go.
There is one catch, it is very heavy which will need quite a few strong guys to get it out of our house.  You will need to provide a trolley and of course transport to take it.  
Please look at the attachments for images.

As we are leaving Switzerland we have a few items we would like to give away before we leave. If you can collect before Thursday 22nd September in Thalwil and would like any of the following items please PM me. I apologise for the photos and the general lack of tidiness......
One Ikea TV stand in black. Has extra glass shelves that will be included. 3 years old. In fairly good condition, no scratches or big marks as far as I know.
One solid pine coffee table with two drawers and a shelf. Not sure how old as it was given to us when we moved over here. Very solid nice bit of furniture, it just won't fit in our new flat.
Ikea outoor furniture, one table two chairs and one two seater bench. Comes with four matching red cushions (two shown in photo). Not in the greatest condition as they have been on our balcony for two years, but they are solid and perfectly good for their purpose.
One Ikea dresser with two shelves and two drawers. Three years old in fairly good condition. Very useful for general junk and papers for around the house.
One Ikea very large white wardrobe. Large cupboard in the middle with a shelf in the middle, shirt hanging space above and trouser hanging space below. Each side there are four drawers. Top half on the left is a cupboard divided up with removable shelves. Top half on the right is a hanging cupboard with a shelf at the top. I don't know how this is as we inherited it with the flat.

Since these  furniture belonged to the previous tenant who just left it behind, I  thought I'd just give them away for free!

The apartment is in Oerlikon near Riedgraben  bus station. Please PM me if you are interested!
Edit: Sorry I wasn't clear earlier. The support shown in the picture which goes under the mattress is all that I am offering for the bed. That's all that was left when I moved in there and seemed to work quite well with a double sized mattress on top. I suppose it's sort of a minimalist design."

"07.04.2010, 13:41",carriej,Basel: World Peace Academy students needs,"Hi, Many of my international colleagues are still looking for the basics, and where they are staying currently does not provide much, although we are trying to make it better every day. Each of these students are remarkable people who have already accomplished so much to make this world a better place, and they continue to want to serve mankind... but they have been living in Basel for 6 weeks without some of the basics to be successful students. Many of them have worked in disaster relief around the world, and have so much to give. It would be great if you would like to donate a stereo, kitchen items, furniture, or know of a multi room house so some could stay together to support one another, but if not, a single or double is great as well. Most of these students can only afford 500CHF rent or less per month. Every semester new students will be arriving with the same needs, so all donations will be shared among the students year after year. They are looking for basic furniture, office supplies, etc. If you have any ideas, or opportunities for them please let me know: many of them are looking for volunteer opportunities in the community to help with youth, elder care, NGOs, etc. Many of them have learned that when you feel a bit sad about your situation, the best thing is to give freely any of your many talents to others, and you will always feel better. Please contact me if you have a donation to be picked up, a suggestion or would like to meet any of these great individuals. Our school is located at Gutterstrasse 81. Thanks, Carrie"

Hello,
We used to live in Switzerland and are now back in the UK. We've just tried to connect our phones up but they are not compatible with the UK system so we were wondering whether anyone would like them. 
They are Siemens Gigaset C470, which means there is a main base and 2 handsets.

We are moving and need to get rid of our couch as we're moving into a rather small house.  It's got a bit of wear and tear on the corners, but is a decent 4 year old couch.  It's got a queen pull-out sleeper mattress that's been used twice.  
The only caveat is that you need to get the darn thing out of our apartment.  When we moved in, it came through the window.  It can go out the window, or perhaps you are ingenious and figure out another way.  I figure going out will require less effort than going in, but perhaps I'm just overly optimistic.
Also, as it's a queen sleeper, it's heavy and large.  Bring a large vehicle and some burly people with you.

I'm moving to another canton in two weeks and am cleaning out the cellar in advance. I found a pair of old ski boots that I'd like to get rid of. They're 3-4 years old, orange and black, and the brand is Head. The plastic bits are certainly scuffed up a bit, but it's not something you'll notice while skiing.  There are no problems with the boots, but I've replaced them this year with custom fit jobs from SureFoot, and there's no reason to keep them around.
I'm a 47, and these boots were slightly large on me, so I guess they're either 47 or 48, but I'm not entirely sure which. If you want them, get in touch with me (PM) by the end of the week, else they go out with the trash!

"08.05.2011, 08:51",SuzieG,Free dark blue corner sofa (Zurich 8041),"Any interest in a large L shaped sofa for free? It's from Ikea, well used (6 years old) and is a dark blue colour (it's slightly darker than in the photos). 
Measurements- 3 seater side is 2.85m, 2 seater side is 2.25m, and depth s 90cm. 
Overall condition is OK, but the covers have quite a few little marks on them but all covers can be washed and I am sure the marks would come out. 
The sofa can be picked up this week form Zurich Leimbach (8041), otherwise it's on its way to the tip.....

"18.05.2011, 13:30",runway,"Free: Roland D-70 synthesizer, needs some fixing","This is a bit unusual, but I've got a Roland D-70 synthesizer that's in great condition EXCEPT for the fact that at least half the keys don't produce sound. It could be fixed by Roland service: it needs new rubber pads in the key mechanisms.
The other catch: it's a North American model, so to plug it in here requires one of those travel transformers...
Oh - I'm afraid there's no box/case for it.
Besides that it's in perfect condition : )
There's one freebie that goes with it: a sound library expansion card (called ""World"" - so-called ""ethnic"" instruments).
For those wondering who could possibly want it: without fixing the keyboard, it CAN of course be used for its internal sound modules (connected to a PC).
If nobody wants it it'll end up being recycled or donated to a music store for its decorative value!"

Atomic e3, 158cm. With poles from K-tec (115cm)
The Supercross ones are pretty good skis, and I have been really pleased with them. Normally I would try to sell them, but since they need a waxing and service (see photo) I will just give them to anyone who's interested. It's the best pair of skis I've tried. I think the price from new was 600chf.
The e3 is my girlfriends. They are for new skiers and a bit old. But they are without a scratch, and in good condition. If you're looking for a free pair of skis to a beginner, you found it
Let me know if you're interested or have any questions. Only available through pick-up in Yverdon.

"04.03.2011, 15:20",Upthehatters2008,Free Car !!,"I have a 1998 Mazda 323 1.5 Venetian (""R"") reg
I bought the car December 2009 to get to Switzerland. Prior to doing so I MOT'ed it, had a full major service , and put new pads/discs and tyres on it.
The car is mechanically very sound. I know and trust the 323, and this one is as good as they get. The only complaint I have is that the previous owner removed the aircon and I don't think the idle adjuster was properly reset, so in 1 in 5 trips, the car stalls when slowing down. Easily solved, just a quick turn of the ignition.
The car has a great brand new Sony Radio in it with an iPod connector (lead in the glovebox)
So, telling it like it is.
The good points
Reliable, economical (40MPG) , light, easy to drive, roomy (rear seats fold flat). 
2011 Vignette
8008 2011 blue zone permit
Rust free (some superficial wheel arch rust - minor/cosmetic)
Only 80,000 Miles. These engines will go for another 100K
Sunroof
Electric Windows 
Alloys (scuffed and tatty)
The bad points.
Expired MOT
My own insurance has run out
Battery may need replacing, as I keep recharging it from flat, yet it stands for another 4 weeks and gets flat again. This impairs the reliability of it.
Headlights are not bright. They maybe need attention.
Driver window switch a bit fiddly, hit and miss to work
So, if you are heading back to the UK, book an appointment at an MOT center for the day you arrive, drive it 3rd party on your own insurance and hey presto, you have a free car. Just needs an MOT (I have not SORNed it). It will pass the MOT with flying colours (Last MOT was a numberplate bulb and nothing else)
I am giving this away, it isn't used any more. I should free up a parking space. The car is worth around £600 , maybe £1000 as a part-ex. The radio should be worth £150 at least. (Paid 300 for it, it has minimal use)
I think the KFC gang on EF should adopt this car.
I will post some pics over the weekend. 
Here is a library PIC
Mine looks just like that.
PM for appointment to view/collect.
It's a great car, just getting it MOT'ed and taxed is such a pointless pain. For someone going back to the UK with a load of stuff, it is a cheap viable option.
Now, flame away about the price. It's zip, zero, nadda.

Bought second-hand from an EFer some time back. I had a lot of fun with it. Now I have a more sophisticated Garmin and no longer use this one.
Probably this is most suitable for an 8-10 year old who likes the outdoors and the idea of maps and navigating. Testimonial of a user.
It does not connect with computer or contain maps but shows longitude/latitude and the Swiss Grid plus altitude, so with a normal Swiss hiking map you can see exactly where you are. I made an EXCEL worksheet so that I could read off the recorded locations and then make an altitude profile of the hike. Very satisfying!  It has a bit of trouble finding enough satellites in deep valleys or between high buildings but for walking in more open regions it works well.
Hopefully it finds a kind owner who will enjoy using it. Contact by PM please."

I bought them new from IKEA's Leksvik range in June 2007.  The exact model is no longer available, but the style is still the same as the Leksvik furniture they have online today.  One is a ""two door"" wardrobe, the other is a ""three door"" (one two door section, and one one door section, both fixed on the same base.)
I will update photo's, measurements etc as soon as I get chance to do so.
Just to re-iterate these are free.IMPORTANT NOTES:
My flat is on the 2nd floor of an old building and has no lift access.  Whoever wants these has to arrange to collect from my flat.  Please have some respect for the free nature of the offer, and don't say you want them if you cannot or will not collect them yourself.
I move on Saturday 9th October - collection can be arranged for any time after that date.
First serious offer who can collect will get them.
If anyone has any questions not answered above, or is interested in taking these free wardrobes, please send me a PM or reply on the thread.  I cannot check regularly, so please be patient until I reply.
If nobody comes in with an offer to collect them before Saturday 16th October, I'll just break them up and bin them - but would prefer if someone else was able to make use of these.

We also took it from a fellow EF member, so there are no directions, but it is a fairly simple assembly and design.
The mattress is an Ikea Hagavik and was purchased new in May, 2010. The mattress has always had a memory foam mattress topper on it, so the mattress itself has hardly been used. The mattress is 160 x 200.http://www.flickr.com/photos/57197715@N04/5397940489/"

I bought a house here in Basel and the previous owner left behind an old washing machine ... a Wyss Mirella Universal 2000.
I don't need this and was wondering if it is of use to anyone.
Please note that this thing is VERY heavy ... in fact I do wonder how anyone managed to deliver this thing in the first place.
I was going to strip it down, and take it to a recycle place, but someone said that these things are extremely expensive and even though it is old, someone could put it to good use, as they last forever.
Anyone interested?"

"12.11.2010, 07:33",joski7,FREE Sofa! (near Oberglatt),"We have some new furniture arriving next Thursday, so need to make room for it!  Therefore, we have a sofa to give away for free!
It is a substantial sofa in white - and has feather filling in the seats.  It does need a recovering, as there are marks on it.  It is a very nice shape, and all the collector would need to do, is to get a nice cover/throw to put over it.  We had thought about keeping it, and having it recovered but now we have a replacement on the way, it seems a little pointless.  Though if you had it recovered, it would probably still be cheaper than buying a sofa! - and it would look very nice! 
It comes from a smoke free home, though we have 2 cats who occasionally take a liking to scratching on one of the arms... but it's a free sofa!
It needs to be picked up by Tuesday/Wednesday next week (Wednesday is absolute latest).  If no one wants it, we'll have the furniture delivery guys take it away when they come.  
I have my other sofa and chair set for sale in another thread, along with a rug, ipod, dvds etc... http://www.englishforum.ch/sale-want...sofa-free.html

"20.08.2010, 09:44",monkeyboy76,Now Free: Panasonic 36 (92cm) Widescreen (CRT) TV [Luzern],"Hi all,
  I have previously asked how to dispose of an older TV [1]. So Im now posting an official message asking if someone to take it away for me. 
  Originally, 7 years ago, this TV did set me back 5.000,- CHF, so I am feeling hard done by letting it go for free, but with all of the cheap LCDs around now I guess the best I can ask for is a decent bottle of wine in exchange? Or maybe 50,- to take the wife for a slap up Mc Donalds dinner?
  The model is a Panasonic TX-36PG50D
  It has a great set of features like:36 inch / 92 cm flat wide screen Picture in picture (watch a second channel in a small window) Side by side picture (watch 2 channels at the same time) Channel scanning (current channel is in middle, others are displayed around it) Direct video link 100 MHz Dolby surround sound technologies (multiple modes)             The picture quality is amazing still. When watching SD TV it will perform better then most of the cheap/average TVs you can pick up in MediaMarkt, and lets face it, how much HD TV are you watching at the moment? 
    Despite moving four times, the TV is in practically new condition. 
  TV comes with all manuals, German, French and Italian. The German version of which can be downloaded here [2], which contains all the information you could ever want to know. 
  It does have its own stand with wheels, but the TV weighs 85 Kg, so will need at least 2 people to move. 
  Let me know if interested.

The TV works perfectly, it's been a great TV, but the new flatscreen TV now takes pride of place and it would be a pity to leave this gathering dust in the basement if someone else has a use for it. It supports dual channel sound where TV broadcasts are made in two languages.
The TV and the remote control are available to collect in Zürich City. I haven't managed to find the original manuals yet, but really everything is fairly obvious. Weighing in at 28.5kg, it's heavy enough if you were thinking of taking it with you on public transport.
And for anyone who's too young to know what a CRT TV is, this is TV the way John Logie Baird meant it to be watched!
The TV is a Sony KV24LS35B- the technical details are: Screen type: 24"" (56 cm visible),           flat FD Trinitron Wega, 16:9 widescreen

Stereo audio out via 2 x phono socket Front Sockets: S-Video, composite video and           stereo audio in, headphone socket 
Teletext: Yes, with 10 page memory Timer/auto standby: Sleep timer, On timer, auto           standby 
WxHxD (mm) / Weight (kg): 695 x 441 x 491 / 28.5

The TV looks like this:"

"19.07.2010, 19:47",petertaylor123,Free - anyone need a lift from Basel to Manchester ?,"maybe a strange thread, but,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the end of this week, I will be driving back to manchester, via the tunnel.
The thought suddenly struck me,,,, does anyone need a lift back to the UK?
It wont be a comfortable trip. Its a 2 seater mazda MX5, so its cramped, noisy and uncomfortable (possibly may get your hair ruffled depending on the weather).
Travelling light would be essential. ie a small (gym) bag and thats about it. The car wont fit anything else in!!
I have not made any firm decisions on day of departure etc so could be flexible.
I am willing to make a drop off along the way should you not wish to travel to sunny Manchester.
(Or if you want small items 'dropped off' to UK and YOU dont want the list in person, also drop me a line)
If you are interested, drop me a line.
I should point out, I'm not looking for any payment here, just some company, somebody to shout a conversation to from accross the car for 14 hours 
Im taking it back to UK to sell it!

"06.05.2010, 17:02",jbrady,[Now Free!] Indian style bed [Aargau],"Hello;
Due to getting an almost new bed from my sons grandmother (who is now in an old folks home) I need to sell a Queen size bed and mattress which I bought from an EF member a couple of months ago.
This is a very big bed, approx 200*190 and is a very comfy one.
This is not a typical modern product and is made of solid wood (and is bloody heavy) and the mattress is a firm one. The person who sold it too me said it cost 900 CHF
The price I am asking for is 200 CHF (I think it is worth it) for the bed and mattress together and is available immediately.
If you are interested you can PM me.
Not trying to be negative, but, the only problems are that is is in kanton Aargau (Schinznach Bad) and that you would probably need a van or two journeys in a big car to take it home. It dismantles into 8 pieces and two pieces of wood - very simple to assemble with no tools.

It's a little way off (Aug/Sept) but we're moving (staying in Switzerland - actually we're going about 500 yards!) and am taking the opportunity to have a clear out.

1982 Yamaha XJ650 Turbo (Not running) free to any enthusiast. Collection required. Location near Oberägeri/Oberaegeri - Zug
I have three of them and have decided to give up on the last one due to lack of time. The bike is almost complete (Missing Turbo). I did get the engine running once. I have since stripped off the exhaust pipes (now boxed) and the bike has been standing. I also do not have the papers, but the bike was registered in Switzerland and the papers should be easy to obtain. I purchased this from ""Rebikling"" (http://www.rebikeling.ch/) in Reiden, so there should be no problems. 
I have loads of spares as well, but please do not ask me to list them as there are too many to mention. I will also not give away individual parts, they must go together. 
The free bike is the last one in the photo attached.
Please note that I am selling this due to lack of time and space, and not because it is a ""Lost cause"". The bike still has life left in it and could be restored with some effort. Most of the XJ650 Turbos ""Beskpoke"" bits are included in the spares, and the engine and frame is the same as used in the standard XJ650 and spare parts are available on Ebay still for this model. For those of you remember, this bike was an icon in 1982.

You won't be able to use them in Switzerland (they point to the wrong side of the road), but if anyone is planning to go back to the UK anytime soon they may have a use for them.
As I said, is a long shot but i thought to give it a go. Skip awaits otherwise."

We're getting a new bed & MUST get rid of our old one. 
I'm now giving this away for free, the only ""but"" is that the bedset must be picked up in Männedorf. Set consists of a double matrass (180cm/200cm) and the support frame underneath it, which consists of 2 frames (90/200) which can be bolted & unbolted. See pics
With some force, you should be able to fold the matrass so it should fit in a midsize van. I can also recommend renting a van from Avis, which we did and cost us 90CHF/hour I believe.
I'm gratefull for anyone who can take this qualilty matrass of our hands! We paid 1000 EURO for it in 2005. Its a firm matrass with a ""support grid"" and a top/bottom indication. Matrass has been flipped, aired & cleaned regularly and has always been covered in an anti-dustmite anti-allergenic cover.

Once again I was digging through my neighbors' offerings on Altpapier day (like Christmas, but more often!) and found four catalogs to various Art Basel exhibitions.
Art 31 Basel - 2000
Art Basel Miami Beach - 2001
Art 37 Basel - 2006
Art 32 Basel - 2001
These are each about 700 pages, full color, text in E/F/G/I. They sell for about a zillion franks each during the art fair. They are all in almost new condition, no spine creases, no marks.
I think they should have a better home than the recycling center, so I would like to palm them off to one of you who would like to have them. 
As it's Christmas coming up, and my family is half a world away, I would like to propose an exchange. You get a nice pile of art books, and I want a present. I don't care what - it can be something super-cheap like a peanut or super-expensive like a new MacBook, as long as it's packed in pretty paper and maybe even has a ribbon on it.

Richard Gere, Colin Firth, Joanna Lumley etc)
A book shop in Basel has kindly agreed to stock the book and have gone further to say they would promote it with a Survival video in the window if I could provide the equipment.  I have sourced a screen and DVD player but the latter doesn't seem to have a port to connect to an external screen .

I've bought this DVD player while in Canada in 2006. it has HDMI output and can upscale/upsample DVD video to 720p or 1080i quality, so standard (NTSC only) video looks good on HD TVs.
I remember being impressed by the quality... back in 2006. 
This set doesn't work with PAL discs and it needs 120v current (60Hz I think, not sure). It works in the USA and Canada. 
I haven't used the DVD player since december 2006. I'm sure it works perfectly. I might still have the original Best Buy receipt somewhere.
model: Sony DVP-NS70H colour: Silver
Pick-up in Horgen ZH more or less any time, any day of the week.

Who wants a battalion of hand cast lead (tin?), hand painted, French Napoleanic-era soldiers and horses? 
Each is about 4cm tall. They come in a variety of poses: Fighting! Musicians! Standing there with a sword! Standing there with a flag! 
Most of them have soltered-on bases so that they can stand up by themselves.
Maybe your (non-teething) kid could play with them. Maybe you collect old Swiss figurines? Maybe these actually have some value as antiques and you would like to ca$h in on them? Maybe you could use them in some kind of D&D game? 
In any case, please take them away. I can't stand seeing them anymore but I can't bring myself to throw them out.

I have some Avent baby bottles that are unused to give away.  They came with some Avent things we bought (bottle sterilizer, bottle heater) but we didn't use them because we'd already bought bottles.
I can't guarantee that the lids haven't been used once or twice, but for sure the bottle body is brand new.  I know because these are the regular Avent bottles and we bought BPA-free bottles, which are yellowish.
There are 5x260 ml bottles and 1x125 ml bottle.  There may be more in the cellar, but my baby-addled brain can't remember right now.  I'll look and post if I find more.  As I said, they're not BPA-free, so if this is a concern for you they're not appropriate.  Otherwise, please let me know.  Location is in Neu Oerlikon near the Bahnhof.
Cheers,

I have some visitors (2 friends). I live in a small apartment so I have to accommodate them in the sitting room. I need a mattress for that days. I am not buying one because of 2 reasons...first I will probably not be in Zurich so long and second I do not have space to keep it after (not storage room or anything). 
So, I was wondering if someone can lend me one for these days. They will be here from the 2nd of september to the 8th. I live in Wipkingen (Zurich). I can pay something like a rent if required. If someone is so kind to lend me one please contact me. As closest as you live from Wipkingen, easiest for me the transportation of the mattress.

I recently completed Resident Evil 5 which I really liked, but I doubt I will be playing it again since it's more of the kind of game you play for the story.
Instead of getting ~35 chf of whatever from the guys at Softridge I thought maybe there's someone here that's in a similar situation with another game. It would then be pain free and cheap to just swap/lend each other a game and that way get to play two games for the price of one.
If someone's interested i have the following:
Resident Evil
CoD4 Modern Warfare
Bio Shock
Colin McRae DIRT
Little Big Planet
GTA 4
I would like to try out: Call of Juarez, Resistance2, Killzone2, Drakes Adventure... well can't think of all now.
It doesn't have to be a permanent swap, could also be ju to either complete the game, or try it out before deciding to buy it.

For sale are two Sun Enterprise 250 servers. One machine is 100% complete including hard drives, the second machine is missing a CD Rom drive but otherwise complete, again including hard drives.
These are substantial pieces of kit and are quite heavy at around 25kg each. Although a little old now at around 10 years there are many of these machines still in service and these two now offered for sale could be useful to a small business user or someone wishing to host a website.
I collected these machines from the previous seller in Lausanne and since then they have sat on the floor in my cellar room. I have not used the machines at all, not even switched them on but I am told by the previous seller that they were being used up until they were the victims of an upgrade.
So, now available for sale again, I can deliver in the Zürich area if required but would prefer buyer collects. Priced to sell now at CHF 400 the pair including some Sun software CD's."

It's ""not cumulable"". Which I suppose means you can only use one of these vouchers per ticket.

My 6 years old son loves selling toys in the flea market. He enjoys dealing with people bargaining with him and earning pocket money!!!  The problem is, he sold almost all the toys he has collected for selling. So I was wondering, if anyone would like to get rid of old toys that are still in good shape that you don't need anymore and just simply have no time to sell them yourselves or feel bad for throwing them away, we would gladly pick up them from your place.
We, my son and I,  both love the flea market. We mostly look for Legos, Playmobils, clothes and whatever that catches my eyes!!! 
Another thing, if you have any Legos that you would like to sell to us or give away, please let me know. My son is absolutely a Lego fan.
I look forward for your reply.

Free would of course be great, but we could afford to give up a few CHFs as well.  Main point is that we don't want to pay retail until we can afford it (or maybe not at all).

We are now getting a new one so the sofa that we have here is now available to anyone who may want it free of charge.
But beware, this sofa is very old and very floral. It comes with two white throws to put over it. So the flowery pattern is covered. It is just very old and again with the throws it is not noticable. 
This sofa would be ideal for an emergency. Maybe someone who has just moved and has lack of furniture and needs something to tie them over.

Ok, got a wish list - we are in Witikon and I travel in to near Bahnhof Stadelhofen almost every day.
Our three children are 9 years, 7 years and 1 year.  Roughly sizes 80+ (for the baby - boy), size 120 for the 7 year old (boy) and 140+ for our 9 year old (Girl)...  
We'd love any clothes for the children (incl. pyjamas/nightwear, shoes etc) if anyone has stuff to give away - we call them 'hand-me-downs' - a bit old is OK - we are not too fussy and I can repair elastics/buttons or do adjustments if needed...
Also, a medium sized fish tank - plastic or glass - up to 1.5 foot...for the kids to have a few goldfish or any other cheap fish!
And thirdly, our daughter would love a bed - her mattress is on the floor, and she is jealous because a fantastic forum member gave us a 'captain's bed for her brother!)...
Thanks!

You can call Outback and get one shipped to Switzerland, but I'm not sure of the price.  The UK price should give you a rough idea though.  (Also helpful if you have friends or family in the UK who might be visiting you here soon or if you're heading to the UK for a visit.)  Quote:    Omega Burners
Check serial number. Example: For serial number for 2006 Omega 200 = 06/OBK/OMG2/**** The first two numbers denotes the year of manufacture. If you are not sure please contact Customer Services on 01622 671771 before ordering. Serial numbers can be found on the front anel or on the right hand side of the barbecue.

"11.03.2008, 17:00",Jonathan_hughes76,FOR SALE : Children's Step 2 Frog Sandpit,"FOR SALE : Children's Step 2 Frog Sandpit
Collection only. From Horgen.
We are asking only CHF 15  for this.
Description:
Step 2 Frog Sandpit.
This fun-loving frog character sandpit for sand play features 2 moulded seats. 
A large protective lid keeps any sand in it clean and dry.
It is made of a sturdy green plastic. 
The bottom/sandpit is the frogs lower body and the upper body is the lid to keep out the rain (not to mention cats and insects). 
As a whole the sandpit is really attractive and our children loved playing in it when they were younger.
In good used condition.
It has a diameter (width) of 82 cm (i.e. 32 inches)
Age suitability: from 12 months to ?
This style of sandpit is currently selling for just under £45 new - but children grow so fast and need new challenges before you realise it - this is one thing that really makes sense to buy second hand.
This will fit in the back of a family sized car and of course you will need a car to transport this.
Sold without sand!
A picture is worth a thousand words. 
See attached pictures (the child's boots are shown for scale)
Please send me a private message or email (titled ""Children's Frog sandpit"") via this Forum if interested.
Many thanks

We both have a Schrebergarten (hobby garden) in our locality, which also consists of a small pond. The lady who owned it before had Salamanders growing in it. She passed on her legacy to us, saying there are two cute little Salamanders!
Alas, these two cute little Salamanders learnt about Birds and Bees earlier than we expected and now are 20-30 strong close knit family. My wife is a little scared of reptiles and to cut long story short, we would be happy if someone would help us relocating them to a better location. 
We are eager to hear from anyone who might be interested in pet Salamanders, so that they may live a happier life (which in turn would also allow us to live ours).
I can of course assist with a big plastic bucket to transfer them, ""not being so scared of them"", and other logistics if need be. But definitely I have never done such a thing before. So please let us know if you are interested.
P.S- We are gone for a month of vacation from 10th April onwards, and anytime before it would be perfect for us. Weekends especially!
Thanks a tonne in advance..."

"24.02.2008, 21:42",Momus,Looking for a GOOD HOME for pet snake ...,"I am looking for a GOOD HOME for Eric, my pet Corn Snake. 
Reason for sale : Regretfully, I'm not in a position to look after him well any more due to work and possibly travelling in the next few months. He moved over here with me about 2 years ago but sending him back to UK is quiet impractical due to cost and logistics. I have all the paperwork etc.
He's very friendly and loves being handled, has a relaxed and docile temperment and I've never had any problems with him. Obviously, he is non-venemous. He's around 3 years old and approx 5 feet long and oraneg in colour. Typical corn snake, he's usually to be found skulking under his log but does like being handled when possible.
Not interested in money for him, more important he goes to a good home with someone who is genuinely interested in taking him on, preferably with some experience of snakes. However, saying that - corn snakes are quite resilient and make good starter snakes, so enthusiasm counts for alot when I decide who can take him. I am happy to give some some guidelines on his upkeep and if necessary, can be contacted afterwards if you had any other questions. 
I have all the equipment you would need - cage, heating, lighting, water bowls and about 3-4 months of food ( frozen mice )
Please drop me a line on this website if you are interested.

I am posting this for a friend. Please PM me if you think you or someone you know could be the new home that Ollie needs. 
Ollie is a 6 year old, black labrador. He is currently living in the greater Zurich area with someone who adopted him from an expat couple who left Switzerland to live in the UK and couldn't find accomodation that would take a dog. This person has a lot going on in her life right now: a close family member is quite ill in her home country, and with her own family and pets, Ollie has just become too much for her to handle right now.
In her words ""Ollie is a delightful dog. Very good with children and very friendly. He is very obedient on commands within the house."" However he is also stubborn and needs a home with experienced pet owners who are not intimidated by his stubbornness and can help him work in this area.
A bit more about the breed:  Quote:    Labradors are smart, and eager to please and do very well in         training classes. Once given a job, no matter what it is, Labradors previously         labeled as a problem, improve tremendously and settle in very contentedly.       source: http://www.thelabradorclub.com/rescue/adopt.html
I'm sure that Ollie could be just the dog that someone is looking for, so please spread the word to anyone that you think might be able to give him a loving home."

we got one of those cheaper ikea carpets (white with black circles or vice versa) measuring about 2m by 1.8m, not sure.
We will like to get rid of it, cos we have new one.
It is well maintained, and clean. (we just don't like the color anymore)
Anyone near baden can pick it up. Just drop me a PM.

"01.10.2006, 17:04",mark,Free: Duplex laser printer - Panasonic KX-P7105,"You currently don't have a laser printer (or any printer) at home, and you are too tight to shell out for one? Well I have the perfect solution:
This is a duplex printer, meaning that it prints on both sides. If you care about not chopping down forests then this is a very useful feature, and not found in many printers.
Why am I getting rid of it? I had some trouble with streaks on the paper - I assumed it was an empty/dirty toner cartridge. I've just replaced the toner with a brand-new one but now the print quality isn't 100%. 
I gave up and ordered another duplex printer, which means you can have this one for free if you'd like to come and pick it up. You won't be able to use it for any work that needs to look professional, but it will be fine for printing out draft stuff, documents to read etc. On the other hand, maybe you have more patience than I do and will fix it so it prints properly - up to you.
If I don't get any takers in the next few weeks I'll just dump it in the bin at media markt. The printer is very similiar to this one [ultrashop.ch]."
"02.10.2006, 11:26",Jen,Strong cardboard boxes available for moving house or storage,"Hi
Have finally had our belongings delivered and our place feels a little more like home. We have however ended up with a large number of cardboard boxes varying in size which I have flat packed. I'm a little reluctant to get rid of them as they will inevitable come in useful for something or someone but due to limited space I can only hang on to them for a short spell. Can anyone make use of them for a house move or storage? 
Cheers 
Jen."
