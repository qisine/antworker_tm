"04.05.2010, 00:23",evilshell,The rules - read these before you post or your thread could be deleted,"Before you post anything in this section, be sure you have read this sticky and followed the rules. If you don't, your thread could be deleted by the mods. Just because you're a forum veteran doesn't mean you don't need to read this sticky and follow the rules. 
In order to start a new thread in the Marketplace, you need to first meet the following criteria: Have 10 posts or more Been a member for 7 days or longer Title
Make your title descriptive, short and to the point. It should conform to the following format: 
[Free] Leather sofa [Basel]
[Free] Woman's bicycle [Geneva]
[Free] Household items, moving sale [Zurich]
Thread titles must include free, the name of the item and the location. Description
What are you giving away? Tell us as much about it as you can. 
For example:   Quote:    Free washing machine in Zurich
Brand: Miele
Height: 80cm
Width: 65cm
Depth: 40cm
Color: White
Small scratches on the side of the machine
1 year old
Capacity: 4.5 kg
Pick up in Dietikon
PM me for details      Picture
A picture is worth a thousand words, or so the cliche goes. But with most household goods, it will help you get rid of your item. 
Try and take a photo that shows the item as clearly as possible, not a small dot across the room. Upload the photo to the English Forum and then embed it into your post, or post it to an external website and use the photo insert tool to include it in your post. Thread BumpingThreads should not be bumped just to gain new exposure. This is considered a breach of netiquette and should be avoided. For more info, please consult Bump_(Internet)
If you want to bring your thread to the top of the pile, post a response to the thread with some new or updated info. It is also acceptable to state that the item is still available if the thread has been there for a few days with no activity. Repeat Postings of the Same Item
Absolutely forbidden. If the mod seeing it is in a nice mood, they might just merge your existing posts, but chances are you'll find your duplicates deleted. General Netiquette
This should be observed at all times. NetiquettePhone Numbers and Email Addresses
Forum rules prohibit the posting of personal contact information including email addresses and telephone numbers. Please use the PM feature instead. Threads with of personal contact information including phone numbers or email addresses will be edited by the mods. What to do when your item is gone
Please report the original post in your thread and ask that it be closed due to the item being taken. Use the Report Post feature, which is the triangle with ! in the middle on the top right hand corner of your post. Language
It should go without saying, we're the English forum, so your post should be in English. (That goes for all sections of EF, not just the Market Place!)Txtspk
Use txtspk and risk having your post or thread deleted without mercy. Remember, English isn't everyone's first language - and even for those who do have English as a first language, txtspk is difficult to read quickly. It doesn't make you look clever or even save you time, so please, use proper English.Trolling
Trolling and taunting the seller is not permitted. Your posts will be deleted, and you could face a ban. By all means, ask legitimate questions, but trolling will not be permitted. 
Not sure what trolling is? wiki/Troll_(Internet)Important Info
Not following these rules will probably find a mod deleting your post. You don't want that, so follow the rules and happy selling and buying. 
Following the rules is simple and easy. Repeatedly violating them is not. Repeated disregard or violation of the rules is cause for an instant ban from the forum. A couple of tips for safe trading
Don't give your full street address until date/time/transport have been arranged to your mutual satisfaction. Street name and nearest tram/bus stop is good enough for initial planning. Sellers often offer to meet at the station - they needn't give away their home address.
Don't outline your whole schedule. If a prospective buyer wants to know when he can come by, state your general preference (e.g. daytime or evening) and make one or two initial suggestions. If he can't meet either of those, ask him for a list of four times that would work for him. You pick one of them and that's it.
If a particular date/time doesn't work for you, it is ""inconvenient"" and nothing more. Don't give reasons.Disclaimer
englishforum.ch is not responsible for goods sold on the forum. We do not benefit from the sales in any way. Any englishforum.ch endorsed sales will be otherwise specified.

It isn't worth transporting it back to the UK with me as I already have a furnished house there.Location: 1803 Chardonne, near (but up a big hill from) La Baume funicular.  Will give exact address if you PM.
Therefore all these items are available for free as long as you can collect them on the evening of 21st, 22nd or 23rd January (may be able to arrange for during the day or early the following week, but unfortunately not the weekend!)Ideally collect on Monday 21st, Tuesday 22nd or Wednesday 23rd from 1830-2230, PM for address, strictly first collect first served as I need to clear it all quickly but I can supply my mobile number via PM if anyone wishes to check before leaving that things are still there.  However because I need to clear it all quickly (and because it would get really complicated) I'm afraid I cannot reserve items for people.
I do not have my own vehicle so cannot deliver.
It's all IKEA furniture, mostly in white, nothing ""fancy"" but perfectly usable and in decent condition, about 1.5 years old.

Please contact me by private message on the forum if you are interested and I can arrange 
a time for you to collect.
Because of limited time this is strictly first to collect first served (on the dates shown), I will update the posting when things are collected, I can't risk ending up with anything left because I will have to pay for it to be removed, and dumping it all would seem such a waste!

"18.09.2012, 20:44",NewOneINseefeld,Please donate your old toys for poor and abandoned kids.,"Dear EF members and guests,
I would like to organize a charity project for children who are very poor, orphaned, abandoned, mentally handicapped and/or disabled, in Serbia.
I would like to collect your old (or new but never used) and not too big: toys, plush toys/animals, games, decorative items (for Xmas and Bdays), books, baby toys, kids and baby items, items for (pre)school, etc. - to give To as many of those kids as possible a 'second hand' Christmas/New Years presents. Their Christmas is on January 6/7th, and New Year is traditional - on December 31st.
I will organize the transportation of these presents to Serbia.
I contacted four organisations/institutions who have lots of children from the above groups. (Located in the eastern part of Serbia - Milosevac: 180 babies&kids, Stamnica: 50, Veliki Popovac: (?), Pomoc Romima-Branicevo: 1200).
As a follow-up I will send to all of you the information about the dates of transport, packing, meeting with children in every institution, and photos whenever I received them.
Please let me know if you have anything to give away but in return get back lots of smiles and thankful kids' hearts!
Thank you for reading this and helping me with this project.
Grateful,
Maya"

It is no longer in the package but has never been used.  It comes with two small cups, is dual voltage, and holds about 2 cups (less than .5 L) of liquid.

"16.10.2012, 10:39",elainemay,[Free] Box spring and bed frame [Zurich],"I have a US queen/UK king size box spring and accompanying basic metal bed frame that I'd like to give away. Please note that this is a US-style box spring, which means it goes underneath a mattress to provide support and stability (i.e. you don't need a lattenrost/wooden slats thingy). It is not a mattress.
The box spring is a Sealy Posturepedic that fits a US queen mattress or a UK king mattress.  It is about 153 cm x 200 cm, which means it might also work with a European 160 cm x 200 cm mattress with a couple of centimeters of overhang on each side. Info on mattress sizes
The bed frame is a standard metal one that adjusts in width and is designed to hold a box spring. It dissembles into two pieces that fold up. It's not a lattenrost- you can't put a mattress in it without a box spring underneath.
Both are in great condition- we used them for about a year before getting a new bed frame that doesn't require a box spring. There are some small scuffs on the box spring from being moved, but it's otherwise clean and in good condition, no stains, odors, or tears.
Please please please, I hope someone can use these items- I hate to take large items in good condition to the dump, and the Brockenhaus doesn't want them because they don't know what a box spring is  I can't deliver, but I will happily help you move them to your vehicle!
Here are some pictures. Yep, it looks like a big rectangle. Pardon the dark areas- those are just shadows and bad phone pic artifacts.  The actual thing is clean and uniform in color. The bed frame is currently in the attic and folded up, but I'm including a picture of a similar one."

Preferably i would like to sell them as a pair so will offer a deal for the two.
I am selling them for 50CHF each or 90CHF for the two if sold to a single purchaser - perfect for someone setting up a new apartment and need furniture.
I have attached pictures of the sofas

"19.09.2012, 12:28",10:30,FREE - Basel - Beautiful Large Carpet,"Hi everyone, as part of my new life, I'm parting with my Enormous Carpet. Its origin is unknown, but it's certainly not some Ikea trash. Its basic color is reddish, but is intricately detailed with various patterns. I'm not going to swear that it's handmade, but it's certainly a special piece.
And it's very large: probably 4m x 4m. It's too big for my new space. I can't even unfold it properly. Damn shame.
And so, since I'm off to the US tomorrow (Thursday 20 Sept, very early) for a long trip, I'm committing a giant sin and putting the carpet out on the street with a gratis sign. If anyone feels inclined, swing by with a cart or a car (it is rather heavy) and it's yours. It's right now out in front of:
Bechburgerstrasse 10 (Breite area of Basel, Tramstop Breite)
The pics don't do it justice. I could only unfold one tiny corner, and there's a pic of the folded carpet. https://picasaweb.google.com/1048733...eat=directlink"

Free for immediate pick up. 
This is a fine wardrobe/armoire/closet thing, probably from Ikea (though I don't know its Ikea name). 
A bit funky -- funny pegs jut out the front in a square matrix, and an elastic band snakes around the pegs. 
What for? I don't know!
Anyways, it'll certainly contain clothing for you, if that's what you're looking for. And the price is right.
The only catch is this is very short notice, as we've got to be out of here by 31 July, Tuesday. It's all still put together, but I could help take it apart if you want. I'll even help take it down to a vehicle. It just has to be cleared out by Tuesday. 
Take a look at the pictures. If you want it, please come and get it. 
Sorry I don't have exact measurements right now. It's about 2m high, and deeper than it is wide. I'd guess about 50-60 cm deep (the width of a normal shirt or coat hanger), and probably 45-55 cm wide (looking at its door from the front).

I have attached a picture of one - not my bed, but this is what it looks like. I have a picture at home, which I can get later on, but I am at work right now. The frame is in decent shape. I think perhaps some of the holes for where the screws drill into, may need a little work, to secure the bed more, but I have used the bed for 2 years now, and it has been ok.
 the bed is 160X200. I am not sure how old it is, as I got it from someone else that was leaving Switzerland. 
 One Caution: The mattress - I would prefer if you took the mattress too, but it does have a few cat urine stains on it (figured i would warn you) -- which they could probably be cleaned up better than I did. Got to love the cats... unfortunately they took it out on my bed when I first got my cats -- ..... I will consider just the frame by itself, since I know that is probably gross - but it can be cleaned more and covered with the right sheet so it would not affect you -- but preference goes to anyone that will take both together... (and i am not even sure how to dispose of the mattress)

(yes its in the pic - bottom left of the table ) I think it is a 13 inch tv or thereabouts... it works ... it has a built in vhs player -- not sure if that works, but I imagine one does not want it for that.. nice for a kitchen or someplace you dont want a big tv at  Has a remote control also.. I can not think of the brand or anything, since I got it used - but it is free  so send me a message if you want to get it.
Can be picked up tomorrow (Saturday - June 30th) otherwise I am gone  for a week to Munich, and pick up could take place late Saturday on July  7th or anytime on Sunday the 8th.
 Please PM me if you want these, and we can arrange pick up.

I'm looking for a second hand bag for my skis, preferably with space for other things to be put in.
I'm in Zurich, based in Affoltern (Kreis 11) and willing to come and pick up (within reason: the closer the better).
If the bag's in good condition, I would also perhaps be willing to pay.
Please send me a PM if you think you can help me, thank you!"
